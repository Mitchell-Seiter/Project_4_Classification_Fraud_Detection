Dear Rocky Mountain Town Bank President, 

Thanks for reaching out. It has come to my attention that you have recently decided to re-vamp your credit card fraud detection system. It is my understanding that the system in place at the moment heavily requires customers to contact the bank if they suspect there is fraudulent activity on their statements. You are looking to try and pre-emptively stop the fraud before it happens, or before customers have to contact you.

Fortunately, we can build very robust fraud detection algorithms based off of the past data that you have forwarded to me already. Looking at the 500,000+ credit card transactions that you have sent me, I should be able to build a few different classification algorithms, that can predict if a transaction is fraud or not, or how likely a given transaction might be fraud. And we can then tune the algorithm and find an appropriate probability threshold for when you want to tag a transaction as fraud, based on your business needs. 

Taking a quick look at the data that you sent me, I think a few key variables we will look at are, amount of transactions, time of day, and vendors, in relation to the person who is making the transaciton. We should be able to start detecting fraud from there, protecting your business and customers! 

For your reference, some of the classification models I plan to use to accomplish this are: k nearest neighbor, logistic regression, naive bayes, and potentially some random forest. I will build a model centered around each of these and then pick and choose one that is most appropriate to help you and your customers the most. This will all be done in Python using various packages such as sklearn and xgboost.

By next Tuesday, 10/27/21, I should have an MVP for you that will have some of these models set up and I can start to compare and see which ones are most appropriate. From there I can refine them and have them completed for you, so by the end you should have a much better looking fraud detection system. 

If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Kind regards,
Mitchell C. Seiter
